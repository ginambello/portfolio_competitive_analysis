                <td><!--Brand Description-->
                <p><i>Sophisticated</i>. A simple white based background. Minimal color except in the ads and the features.
		The audience is not the average magazine reader.
		Flaboyant images do not dominate the fold.
		The distinct style of this webpage is defined by the typography.  Notice the "W" in The New Yorker.
		Although there is a cartoon style, the cartoons revolve around political/artisitc/etc figures rather than the chitter-chatter of popular tabloid rags.
		Pay attention to how well-dressed the charater in the logo is; this isn't your average Joe.  It gives you an idea of the intended reader of this magazine.</p>
		<p><i>Examiner</i>. Take a look at the upper left logo cartoon.
		The charater has a spectacle examining the text "The New Yorker".
		The spectacle is a symbol of "critique".  It symbolizes examining the news with a critical eye.
		The feature articles surround the US election, Thatcher, outsourcing with opinions on the ongoings in congress and international affairs.  
		</p>
		<i>American</i>.  The dominant colors are white, red, and blue.  The heading "The New Yorker" alludes that New York is America,
		furthermore that New Yorkers are the 'better' Americans.
		It plays with this idea that New Yorkers are the most informed, therefore bringing you the news on America.

                <td><!--Functionality Description-->
		The site is used to promote subscription to this magazine.
		You can subscribe by selecting "Subcribe" in the topbar section of the site and also by selecting "Subscribe" in the upper right corner.
		The option to subscribe is not only located in the fold you can also subscribe below the fold.
		The commodities are style and news. To do this the site displays top news in containers within the page.
		The images like the cartoons and the typography are in essence the shiny things in the window display; it's what draws you into this magazine.

                <td><b>Interactivity</b></td>
                <td><!--Interactivity Description-->
		The interactivity is simple.  The basic search engine to type a desired entry.
		Then there is a top gallery that allows you to navigate through 5 images.
		Though this coverflow type gallery is timed you can move through the images as well by clicking on the next gray dot in the series.

            <tr>
                <td><b>Navigation</b></td>
                <td><!--Navigation Description-->
		There are 7 main places to go within the site.  They are: in the magazine, blogs, audio&video, listings, cartoons, topics and archive.
		The link to these pages are in the top bar.  Underneath this topbar is a sub-topbar that holds content specific to each of the 7 pages.
		Let's say for example that you are trying click on blogs.  You will go to the blogs page, but once in the the blogs page it is difficult to differentiate between
		in the magazine and blogs pages since the set up is the same.  There is however a little light gray header on the left above the cover flow gallery that says
		"The New Yorker | Magazine" or "The New Yorker | Online Only".  The user is supposed to make the link that "Online Only" means that you are in the
		blogs page. This is a little confusing, but then again you can look at the web address and it will tell you "http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs".
		To go back to the home page you can click on the left logo, which consists of the cartoon and the "The New Yorker" text.
