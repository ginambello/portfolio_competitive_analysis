		<p><i>Examiner</i>. Take a look at the upper left logo cartoon.
		The charater has a spectacle examining the text "The New Yorker".
		The spectacle is a symbol of "critique".  It symbolizes examining the news with a critical eye.
		The feature articles surround the US election, Thatcher, outsourcing with opinions on the ongoings in congress and international affairs.  
		</p>
		<i>American</i>.  The dominant colors are white, red, and blue.  The heading "The New Yorker" alludes that New York is America,

		The creatures in the image are ugly looking but they are not harmful looking nor disgusting.  They are intriguing and interact with the user in a curious
		manner.  The frog thinks he is a horse. Another creature is French and the ghosts float around the mountain as the cho-cho train passes by the tracks.
		It is playful as in a child's creation/imagination.
		</p>
		<p><i>Unique</i>. These monsters exist no where else but on this site.  It creates an environment for the user, moreover a fictional one, a place
		that does not exist in our lives.  Because this image is hand-drawn it is one of a kind.  It is an artist proof that is not replicable.   
		</p>
		<i>Messy</i>. Lines in the image are hand-drawn and therefore not straight.  There are no guidlines guiding the inside of the image, it is free-hand completely.
		The logo: "Greetings From.. GUBLER-land"  is slanted downward creating a droppy effect.  The cho-cho tracks have jagged lines and some lines look redrawn on top
		of another.  The text is wavy with different font types, it breaks the order much like imagination does.
